# OLG-Model
This is an implementation of the Canonical Diamond Overlapping Generations Model.

The utility considered is a log-utility `u(c) = log(c)`.

The production function is `F(K,L) = A K^alp L^{1-alp}`.

The use of `predetermined_variables` allows for an easier notation in the dynare code.

There are 4 different types of simulations: Permanent and temporary changes to TFP and labour growth.
